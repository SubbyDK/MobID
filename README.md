# MobID for Turtle WoW

I have started this crazy project to collect all IDs for every mob in the game.

## 🤔 But why, Subby? Why?

I believe it would be incredibly valuable to have a centralized place where other addons can easily get the **Mob ID** for any creature. This database will make creating certain community addons for Turtle WoW much easier.

## 🤝 Good plan! How can I help?

You can help by simply installing this addon! From time to time, please send a file to me so I can look up and consolidate the new IDs.

The file you need to send is located here:
`\Turtle WoW\WTF\Account\[YOUR ACCOUNT NAME]\SavedVariables\MobID.lua`

## ⚙️ How does it work?

The addon collects the **mob name**, **mob level**, and the **zone** you are currently in.

I then use this information to find the corresponding Mob ID on the official Turtle WoW database, and I manually enter it into this project's master database.

## 💯 Can you guarantee that all IDs are correct?

**No... Absolutely not.**

With so many mobs to enter manually, there are bound to be some mistakes.

However, I **can** guarantee that:
* I will do my very best to minimize errors.
* I will promptly fix all errors that are reported to me.
