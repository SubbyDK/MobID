# MobID for Turtle WoW
I have started this crazy project to collect all IDs for all mobs in the game.  

## But why, Subby? Why?
I think it would be great to have a place where other addons can get the ID for a mob.  
It will make creating certain addons a bit easier.  

## Good plan! How can I help?
You just install this addon and, from time to time, send a file to me and then I will look up all the IDs.  
The file you need to send is:  
\Turtle WoW\WTF\Account\[ACCOUNT NAME]\SavedVariables\MobID.lua

## How does it work?
It collects the mob name, mob level, and the zone you are in.  
Then I find the ID for that specific mob on the Turtle WoW database and enter it into the project database.
